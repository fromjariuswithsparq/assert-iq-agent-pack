# Generate test plan

Produce a working test plan. Not a 30-page document; a one-page operating plan a delivery team can actually use.

## When to use this skill

| Request type | Route |
|---|---|
| "Test plan for [feature/sprint/release]" | **This skill** — proceed below |
| "Write test cases for [feature]" / specific steps requested | **Not this skill** — redirect to test case generation |
| "What should we test?" without scope/timeline context | **Clarify** — ask for scope before proceeding |
| "Review our testing approach" / feedback on existing plan | **Not this skill** — provide feedback directly |

If the request is about test case steps:
> "You're asking for test cases (execution steps), not a test plan (strategy document). Want me to generate test cases instead, or do you need a test plan for the broader feature?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Source |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Scope | Yes | Feature name, sprint, release, or work-item set |
| Audience | Yes | Embedded QE pod, stakeholder, or both |
| Work items / ACs | Preferred | MCP if available; otherwise ask user or work from feature description |
| Risk context | Preferred | Recent escapes, churn areas, known gaps |
| Constraints | If any | Timeline, environment limitations, team capacity |

**When MCP is unavailable:** Work from whatever the user provides. State assumptions explicitly.

**When risk context is unknown:** Ask: "Any recent defects, high-churn areas, or known gaps I should weight?" If unavailable, state: "Risk assessment structural only (new integrations, complexity, dependency count). Validate priorities with the team."

**When scope is unstable:** Surface instability as the primary finding. Produce a partial plan for known items and explicitly list what's needed before the plan can be completed. Do not fabricate confidence.

**When scope is contradictory:** If the user asks for a test plan that includes items outside the stated scope (e.g., "test plan for feature X" but also mentions testing Y and Z), clarify: "Your scope says X but you've also mentioned Y and Z. Should the plan cover all three, or just X?"

## Complexity calibration

| Level | Signals | Template target | Sections to include |
|-------|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Trivial** | Single bug fix, config change, ≤ 1 day | ≤ 30 lines | Objective, Scope, Approach (1 line), Exit Criteria |
| **Feature** | Single feature, clear boundaries, 1-2 sprints | ≤ 80 lines | All sections, concise |
| **Release** | Multi-feature, cross-team, multiple envs | ≤ 150 lines | All sections + per-feature risk differentiation |
| **Program** | Multi-release, 3+ months, org-wide | ≤ 250 lines | Full template + phased schedule + checkpoints |

Match output length to complexity.

## Procedure

1. **Gather context.** MCP if available; otherwise work from provided inputs.
2. **Assess complexity** using the calibration table.
3. **Aggregate ACs** across scope. Classify by test approach.
4. **Identify high-risk areas:**
   - Components with recent escapes (if known)
   - High-churn areas (if observable)
   - New integrations or vendor dependencies
   - Weak existing coverage
   - Ambiguous or missing ACs
5. **For multi-feature releases:** Prioritize by risk. Effort proportional to risk, not equal.
6. **Generate the plan** using the template. Drop empty/speculative sections.
7. **Verify** output matches complexity calibration target. Trim if over.
8. **Output as markdown.** If `tracker.type = ado`, also produce importable ADO Test Plan structure.

## Approach distribution heuristics

Starting points — adjust with rationale:

| Project type | Auto | Manual | Exploratory | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| API / backend | 70% | 10% | 20% | Deterministic I/O; explore for integration unknowns |
| UI-heavy | 30% | 40% | 30% | Visual/UX manual-heavy; explore device/browser edges |
| Data pipeline | 60% | 20% | 20% | Validation rules automate; manual for data quality |
| New integration | 40% | 20% | 40% | Unknowns demand exploration; automate contract boundaries |
| Security-sensitive | 50% | 15% | 35% | Automate known patterns; explore novel attack surfaces |

## Output template

### Section rules

- **Objective:** One sentence. Anti-pattern: "This test plan aims to ensure quality..."  Better: "Prove [X] is safe to ship by validating [Y]."
- **Scope:** Always include Out with rationale. Anti-pattern: "Out of scope: everything else."
- **Approach:** Must sum to ~100%. Rationale mandatory. Use heuristics as starting points.
- **Risk areas:** Include mitigation for every HIGH+ risk. Anti-pattern: risks without mitigations.
- **Exit criteria:** Measurable only. Reject: "tests look good," "QA signs off." Accept: "0 P1/P2 open," "regression suite green."
- **Decision points:** Evidence required, not just dates.
- **Drop sections** that would be empty.

### Constraint Analysis section (when conflicts exist)

```markdown
## Constraint Analysis
| Constraint | Conflicts With | Consequence |
|------------|---------------|-------------|

**Residual risks that cannot be fully mitigated:**
1. [Risk] — because [constraint]. Accepted by: [who].
```

### Adaptation rules

| Scenario | Adaptation |
|----------|-----------|
| No test environment | Shift to production validation (canary, feature flags, monitoring). State residual risk. |
| No team capacity info | Omit Owners. Note: "Assign owners once allocation confirmed." |
| Fast turnaround (< 3 days) | Trivial template. Entry + Exit criteria only. |
| Constraints conflict | Add Constraint Analysis section. |
| Risk history unavailable | Note structural-only assessment. Recommend team validation. |

## Governance

- Do not pad. Drop empty sections.
- Exit criteria must be measurable.
- Surface gaps rather than fabricate confidence.
- When constraints conflict, surface tensions, state residual risk, propose pragmatic mitigation.
- Multi-feature releases: effort proportional to risk.

## Worked examples

### Example A: Feature-level

**Input:** "Test plan for payment retry feature. Retries failed payments 3x with exponential backoff. Touches payment + notification services. P1 last month: duplicate charges from retries."

**Complexity:** Feature. Target: ≤ 80 lines.

```markdown
# Test Plan: Payment Retry Feature

## Objective
Prove retry logic is safe (no duplicate charges) and effective (recovers transient failures).

## Scope
| In | Out | Rationale |
|----|-----|-----------|
| Retry logic (1-3 attempts, backoff) | Provider internals | We control retry, not provider |
| Idempotency (duplicate prevention) | Notification design | Integration only |
| Notification on final failure | Config tuning | Ship defaults, tune later |

## Approach
| Type | % | Focus | Rationale |
|------|---|-------|-----------|
| Automation | 60% | Retry sequences, idempotency, timing | Deterministic, regression-critical |
| Manual | 15% | Notification delivery, admin UI | UX verification |
| Exploratory | 25% | Race conditions, concurrent retries | P1 history demands exploration |

## Risk Areas
| # | Area | Level | Mitigation |
|---|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Duplicate charges | CRITICAL | Idempotency validation + exploratory charter |
| 2 | Backoff under load | HIGH | Load test retry sequences |
| 3 | Notification coupling | MEDIUM | Contract test at boundary |

## Exit Criteria
- 0 duplicate charges across all retry scenarios
- Retry automation green (all patterns)
- Exploratory findings dispositioned
- Notification verified for final-failure path

## Decision Points
| When | Decision | Evidence |
|------|----------|----------|
| Automation complete | Proceed to exploratory? | Retry/idempotency tests green |
| After exploratory | Ship? | Findings dispositioned, 0 P1/P2 |
```

38 lines.

### Example B: Trivial-level

**Input:** "Test plan for bumping session timeout from 30→60 min."

**Complexity:** Trivial. Target: ≤ 30 lines.

```markdown
# Test Plan: Session Timeout Change (30→60 min)

## Objective
Confirm timeout change takes effect without breaking session management.

## Scope
| In | Out | Rationale |
|----|-----|-----------|
| Session expiry at 60 min | Auth flows | Only timeout changed |
| Idle vs. active behavior | Load testing | Config, not capacity |

## Approach
Automation only — verify timeout in integration suite. ≤ 2 hours effort.

## Exit Criteria
- Integration test confirms 60 ± 1 min expiry
- No regression in session create/destroy tests
- Verified in staging browser
```

14 lines.

### Example C: Release-level (multi-feature)

**Input:** "Test plan for Release 3.0: payment gateway swap (high-risk, new vendor), reporting dashboard (medium-risk, new data source), admin role cleanup (low-risk, config only). 3-week window, staging + pre-prod available."

**Complexity:** Release. Target: ≤ 150 lines.

```markdown
# Test Plan: Release 3.0

## Objective
Validate three features ship safely with confidence proportional to risk — highest on payment gateway swap.

## Scope
| In | Out | Rationale |
|----|-----|-----------|
| Payment gateway: full transaction lifecycle | Vendor internals | Boundary at our API |
| Reporting: new data source integration | Report content accuracy | Product owns content |
| Admin roles: config migration | User provisioning | Separate system |

## Approach (per-feature, risk-proportional)
| Feature | Auto | Manual | Exploratory | Rationale |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Payment gateway | 60% | 15% | 25% | New vendor = unknowns; automate regression |
| Reporting | 50% | 30% | 20% | Data accuracy needs spot-checks |
| Admin roles | 80% | 20% | 0% | Config migration is deterministic |

## Risk Areas
| # | Feature | Risk | Level | Mitigation |
|---|---------|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Payment | New vendor, zero prod track record | HIGH | Sandbox end-to-end + canary |
| 2 | Payment | Transaction data integrity | HIGH | Reconciliation tests |
| 3 | Reporting | Data source latency impacts | MED | Performance threshold tests |
| 4 | Admin | Role migration breaks access | LOW | Pre/post migration diff |

## Environments
| Env | Purpose | Prerequisite |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| Staging | Feature validation | Vendor sandbox credentials |
| Pre-prod | RC validation | Prod-like data volume |

## Schedule
| Milestone | Week | Gate |
|-----------|------|------|
| Feature complete | W1 | All code merged, staging green |
| Integration validated | W2 | Cross-feature tests pass, 0 P1 |
| RC1 on pre-prod | W3 | Exit criteria met |

## Exit Criteria
- Payment: 0 transaction failures in end-to-end suite, reconciliation balanced
- Reporting: data accuracy ≥ 99.5%, latency < 3s P95
- Admin: role migration verified (pre/post diff clean)
- Overall: 0 P1, ≤ 2 P2 with documented mitigations

## Decision Points
| When | Decision | Evidence |
|------|----------|----------|
| End W1 | Proceed to integration? | Feature tests green |
| End W2 | Cut RC1? | Integration green, 0 blockers |
| End W3 | Ship? | All exit criteria met |

## Owners
| Activity | Owner |
|----------|-------|
| Payment automation + exploratory | QE-1 |
| Reporting validation | QE-2 |
| Admin migration verification | QE-3 |
| Pre-prod coordination | QE Lead |
| Release sign-off | QE Lead + PM |
```

### Example D: Adversarial — constrained (no test env + zero automation)

**Input:** "Test plan for API migration. Moving from REST to GraphQL. No staging environment, must test in production with feature flags. No existing test automation. Ship in 4 weeks."

**Complexity:** Feature, but constrained. Target: ≤ 80 lines. Constraint Analysis required.

```markdown
# Test Plan: REST→GraphQL API Migration

## Constraint Analysis
| Constraint | Conflicts With | Consequence |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| No staging env | Need to validate before prod exposure | All validation happens in prod behind flags |
| Zero automation | Regression detection at scale | Manual-only until automation built |
| 4-week deadline | Building automation from zero | Automation available mid-cycle at best |

**Residual risks that cannot be fully mitigated:**
1. Production exposure during validation — because no isolated environment. Accepted by: [Engineering Manager].
2. Late-found regressions — because automation won't exist until week 2-3. Accepted by: [Tech Lead].

## Objective
Migrate API from REST to GraphQL without breaking existing consumers, validated in production behind feature flags.

## Scope
| In | Out | Rationale |
|----|-----|-----------|
| GraphQL equivalents for all REST endpoints | New GraphQL-only features | Migration parity first |
| Consumer backward compatibility | Performance optimization | Ship correct, tune later |
| Feature flag rollout/rollback | Flag infrastructure itself | Assumed working |

## Approach
| Type | % | Focus | Rationale |
|------|---|-------|-----------|
| Automation | 40% | Build contract tests weeks 1-2, use thereafter | Invest early for regression safety |
| Manual | 25% | Consumer compatibility spot-checks | Until automation catches up |
| Exploratory | 35% | Edge cases in query translation, error handling | New integration = unknowns |

## Risk Areas
| # | Risk | Level | Mitigation |
|---|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Consumer breakage in prod | HIGH | Feature flag at 1% → 10% → 50% → 100% with rollback |
| 2 | No regression net weeks 1-2 | HIGH | Prioritize contract test creation, manual smoke tests |
| 3 | Query translation edge cases | MED | Exploratory charters per endpoint group |

## Exit Criteria
- All REST endpoints have GraphQL equivalents (contract tests green)
- Feature flag at 100% for ≥ 1 week with no rollbacks triggered
- 0 consumer-reported issues at full rollout
- Error rate ≤ pre-migration baseline

## Decision Points
| When | Decision | Evidence |
|------|----------|----------|
| End week 2 | Begin rollout? | Contract tests green, manual smoke pass |
| At 10% traffic | Expand? | Error rate stable, no consumer complaints |
| At 100% for 1 week | Migration complete? | All exit criteria met |
```
